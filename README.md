# libstatemachine
Simple implementation(s) of a finite state machine

I just bought a mechanical keyboard and wanted to write some code :)

I have been an engineering manager for the last few years, this is an old interview question I probably asked over 200 times interviewing software engineering candidates and saw different types of solutions. I think it's a good design question because it shows how people are modelling a problem (a simple one in this case) and how well and fast they are able to understand a new concept and implement it, what is a generic, reusable facility and how an API is designed. It also helps place candidates on a software engineering "spectrum" - from electrical engineers that solve it with a set of if-else statements to high level engineers solving it with OOP (and of course those who don't get the concept at all and usually end up drawing a set of circles and arrows to illustrate the state machine).

The implementations here (in C and C++) are my favorites, there are a lot of other good implementations, but I like the simplicity of the API and the usability of the library from an external user which in my eyes is how you measure a good library (if someone who doesn't know it at all can easily use it and it would just work).
