# libstatemachine
Simple implementation(s) of a finite state machine

I have been an engineering manager for the last few years, this is an old interview question I probably asked over 200 times interviewing software engineering candidates and saw different types of solutions. I think it's a good design question because it shows how people are modelling a problem (a simple one in this case) and how well and fast they are able to understand a new concept and implement it.

I just bought a mechanical keyboard and wanted to write some code :)
